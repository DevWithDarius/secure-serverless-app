# SecureServerlessApp

SecureServerlessApp is a robust, secure serverless web application demonstrating best practices in AWS architecture, security, and CI/CD automation.

---

## Project Overview

This project showcases a fully automated CI/CD pipeline deploying a serverless application on AWS using:

- **AWS Lambda** for scalable, event-driven compute.
- **Amazon API Gateway** as the secure API front door.
- **AWS CodePipeline** for continuous integration and delivery.
- **AWS CodeBuild** for build automation.
- **AWS IAM** roles and policies adhering to the principle of least privilege.
- Secure handling of secrets and environment variables.
- Infrastructure as Code with AWS SAM or CloudFormation.

The application is designed with security and scalability in mind, making it a practical demonstration for AWS Solutions Architect and Security+ certification skills.
